It is October. I'm getting married in December. 

I'm not sure if I want to write about that stuff though. 

Maybe it can be more privacy oriented. Maybe something to do with internet capture. 

I really do feel like trying to write a sequel piece to the one that I wrote for Bot Populi. 

Let's hope I get there eventually.
